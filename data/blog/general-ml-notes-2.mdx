## Questions related to sampling and training data

1. If you have 6 shirts and 4 pairs of pants, how many ways are there to choose 2 shirts and 1 pair of pants? (7.2.1)

   This is a combinatorics warmup question. We can split it into two parts. First, we can count number of possible ways to choose 1 pant.
   Since we have 4 pants, we have four different sets. Then, to construct a group of 2 shirts and 1 pair of pants, for each set containing a pant we can add
   two shirts. In particular, for each pant, we have $${6 \choose 2} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} = 15$$ different sets of two shirts. Thus, in total we have $$4*15 = 60$$ ways.

2. Markov Chain Monte Carlo Sampling [TODO]
