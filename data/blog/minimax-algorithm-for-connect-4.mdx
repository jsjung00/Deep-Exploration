### Introduction/Background

My friend and I used to joke that brute force search based methods are "dumb" and not worth thinking about.
However, our perspective may have been misguided since a lot of problems can be effectively solved using a brute force search
based method. For example, an AI player can competitively play the game Connect 4 using the minimax algorithm and simply
searching through
the game tree and finding the state that maximizes (or minimizes) the player's value. This post will cover how minimax was used
to create a Connect 4 AI player, including the implementation of alpha beta pruning, an improvement to the minimax algorithm, and
a heuristic evaluation function.

### Introduction to Minimax

Minimax is an algorithm used for turn based games, such as Connect 4. The term "minimax" can be derived from the
adversial nature of a game such as Connect 4. If we denote larger values for a state to mean that Player 1 has a higher chance of winning, then
lower values necessarily mean that Player 2 has a higher chance of winning. In other words, Player 1 is looking to _maximize_ the
values of the game states, whereas the adversial Player 2 is looking to _minimize_ the values of the game states.

In particular, we can construct a game state tree that the players can traverse to optimize their chance of winning.
We can think of the empty connect 4 board as the beginning state and in our tree it would be the root node. Then, the first player
(say Player 1), can place a piece in any of the 7 columns. We then would have 7 children nodes connecting to the root node, where
each children node is a game state containing Player 1's first move.

Since Connect 4 alternates turns, the next move would be for Player 2. For each child node representing a state with
one Player 1 move, we can imagine another 7 child nodes under that child node representing the 7 possible moves
that Player 2 can move to. Then, we can do this iteratively to develop our game tree, stopping and reaching a
terminal (leaf) node when there is either four in a row or no more moves to make.

We can think of assigning values to the game states in our game tree. First we denote Player 1 as
the maximizer and Player 2 as the minimizer. Then, in the Connect 4 AI program,
we assigned the terminal states (leaf nodes) a large positive value if the game is won by Player 1, a large
negative value if the game is won by Player 2, and 0 if the game is a draw.

Then, we can recursively assign values to the parent nodes. This is best illustrated by an example.

![minimax](/static/images/connect_four/minimax_example.png)

For example, on the maximizer's turn (Player 1), the player will look at all of the children node of some state $$s$$
and denote the value of $$s$$ as the maximum value of all the children nodes. Conversely, on the minimizer's turn,
(Player 2), the player will look at all the children node of $$s$$ and denote its value as the minimum value of
all the children nodes.

The pseudo-code for the minimax algorithm (from Wikipedia) is here:

```
function  minimax( node, depth, maximizingPlayer ) is
    if depth = 0 or node is a terminal node then
        return the heuristic value of node
    if maximizingPlayer then
        value := −∞
        for each child of node do
            value := max(value, minimax(child, depth − 1, FALSE))
        return value
    else (* minimizing player *)
        value := +∞
        for each child of node do
            value := min( value, minimax( child, depth − 1, TRUE ) )
        return value
```

### Alpha-Beta Pruning

We note that we don't have to evaluate the entire search tree. In fact, we can speed up the computation by
eliminating sub-trees that we know don't need to be evaluated.

![minimax](/static/images/connect_four/ab_pruning.png)

For example, for the second to last layer with the 4 node, once the minimizer scans through the child nodes and gets
has a minimum, it doesn't need to process any node that is larger than that minimum (i.e 5). I found it helpful to work through
an example of alpha-beta pruning
step by step, which can be seen [here.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimax-algorithm-in-game-theory-set-4-alpha-beta-pruning/)
In particular, the rule is that if we denote $$\alpha$$ as worst (minimum) score the maximizing player can get and $$\beta$$
the worst score (the maximum) score that the minimizing player can get, we can reject sub-trees of states where
$$\beta < \alpha$$.
The pseudo-code with alpha beta pruning implemented is here

```
function alphabeta(node, depth, α, β, maximizingPlayer) is
    if depth = 0 or node is a terminal node then
        return the heuristic value of node
    if maximizingPlayer then
        value := −∞
        for each child of node do
            value := max(value, alphabeta(child, depth − 1, α, β, FALSE))
            if value ≥ β then
                break (* β cutoff *)
            α := max(α, value)
        return value
    else
        value := +∞
        for each child of node do
            value := min(value, alphabeta(child, depth − 1, α, β, TRUE))
            if value ≤ α then
                break (* α cutoff *)
            β := min(β, value)
        return value
```

### Heuristic Evaluation Function

With a very large search tree, it's often not computationally feasible to search through all the layers of the tree.
To make things more computationally tractable, one can limit the search to a max depth and simply create a heuristic value
for the state at the end of the truncated max depth search.

For the program, I constructed the heuristic evaluation function as follows. I considered every window of 4 in the
board (i.e 4 horizontal, 4 vertical, 4 diagonal). Then, for each window, if the window was not blocked (i.e had no
opponent piece to prevent a connect 4), I counted the number of player pieces in that window. I then gave the following
scores: having 1 piece was a score of 0.5, having two pieces was a score of 3, having three pieces was a score of 9.
(Note that the board did not have any 4 in a row since it would be a terminal state and assigned a terminal value).
To make the program a defensive player as well- good at blocking the opponent from getting 4 in a row- I rewarded
blocks. If the opponent player had 1 piece it got a score of 0.5, for 2 pieces it got a score of 2, for 3 pieces it
got a score of 40. I upweighted the score of blocking three opponet pieces to prevent the bot from letting the opponent win by placing the fourth piece
in a three in a row window.

The score of the board was a weighted multiple of the sum scores of all the windows, normalized by the number of pieces. This prevents later
board states (which naturally have more combos) from having an artifically higher value than earlier states. We note that
this score is by construction larger than zero and thus will be multiplied by 1 or -1 depending if that player is
maximizing or minimizing. The code looks
like this:

```js
return (
  (1.5 *
    (playerCombos[1] * 0.5 +
      playerCombos[2] * 3 +
      playerCombos[3] * 9 +
      blockedCombos[1] * 0.5 +
      blockedCombos[2] * 2 +
      blockedCombos[3] * 40)) /
  totNumberPieces
)
```

### Discounting longer games

To encourage the program to be ruthless and secure a victory in as little moves as possible, I discounted the
value of the board by the depth of the state in the game search. The intuition is that the value of a board one move from now should
be higher than the value of a board ten moves from now, all else equal.  
In particular, the discount function was linear where a board with the max depth number of moves had a discount factor $$0.75$$,
and a board with a depth 0 had a discount factor of $$1$$ (i.e no value loss).
In code we have

```js
const discountedHeuristicValue = heuristicValue - 0.25 * heuristicValue * (depth / MAX_DEPTH)
```

### Alpha Beta Minimax Code with Heuristic Value

In sum, the program code is the following:

```js
const MAX_BASE = 80
const MIN_BASE = -80

function minimax(board, depth, isMaximizing, alph, beta) {
  //check if game terminated
  const overResult = isOver(board)
  if (overResult == 1) {
    return MAX_BASE - 0.25 * MAX_BASE * (depth / MAX_DEPTH)
  }
  if (overResult == 2) {
    return MIN_BASE + 0.25 * MAX_BASE * (depth / MAX_DEPTH)
  }
  //heurustic value if at max depth
  if (depth >= MAX_DEPTH) {
    const playerNum = humanStarts ? 2 : 1
    const heuristicValue = altHeuristicValue(board, playerNum, false)
    const discountedHeuristicValue = heuristicValue - 0.25 * heuristicValue * (depth / MAX_DEPTH)
    if (playerNum === 1) {
      return discountedHeuristicValue
    } else {
      return -1 * discountedHeuristicValue
    }
  }

  //game non-terminated
  if (isMaximizing) {
    let bestVal = -200
    for (let j = 0; j < 7; j++) {
      const nextMove = getNextMove(j, board)
      if (nextMove == null) {
        continue
      }
      let childBoard = board.map((row) => row.slice())
      childBoard[nextMove[0]][nextMove[1]] = 1
      let childVal = minimax(childBoard, depth + 1, false, alph, beta)
      bestVal = Math.max(bestVal, childVal)
      alph = Math.max(alph, bestVal)
      if (beta <= alph) {
        break
      }
    }
    return bestVal
  } else {
    let bestVal = 200
    for (let j = 0; j < 7; j++) {
      const nextMove = getNextMove(j, board)
      if (nextMove == null) {
        continue
      }
      let childBoard = board.map((row) => row.slice())
      childBoard[nextMove[0]][nextMove[1]] = 2
      let childVal = minimax(childBoard, depth + 1, true, alph, beta)
      bestVal = Math.min(bestVal, childVal)
      beta = Math.min(beta, bestVal)
      if (beta <= alph) {
        break
      }
    }
    return bestVal
  }
}
```

In order for the program to make a move, it gets the current board state, finds the possible moves it can make,
and passes the potential board states into the minimax function above to get the value of each move. Then, it simply
chooses the best move (either maximum value for maximizing player or the minimum value for minimizing player) as the move to make.
