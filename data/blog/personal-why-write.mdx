## Why I write

At UChicago I was fortunate to take an extrodinary class on social and political thought. I still think about
one of the books that we covered to this day, "The Human Condition" by Hannah Arendt. It pops up in my mind when I reflect on
what makes a meaningful and flourishing life.

"This is true of no other activity in the _vita activa_. Men can
very well live without laboring, they can force others to labor for them,
and they can very well decide merely to use and enjoy the world of the things
without themselves adding a single useful object to it; the life of an exploiter
or slave-holder and the life of a parasite may be unjust, but they certainly are human.
A life without speech and without action, on the other hand—and this is the only way of life
that in earnest has renounced all appearance and all vanity in the biblical sense of the word—
is literally dead to the world; it has ceased to be a human life because it is no longer
lived among men.

In acting and speaking, men show who they are, reveal actively their unique personal identities
and thus make their appearance in the human world, while their physical identities appear without
any activity of their own in the unique shape of the body and sound of their voice.
