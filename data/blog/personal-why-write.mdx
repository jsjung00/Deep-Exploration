## Why I write

At UChicago I was fortunate to take an extrodinary class on social and political thought. I still think about
one of the books that we covered to this day, _The Human Condition_ by Hannah Arendt. It pops up in my mind when I reflect on
what makes a meaningful and flourishing life. Below are few excerpts that I think capture why writing (categorized under speech)
is so important.

> This is true of no other activity in the _vita activa_. Men can
> very well live without laboring, they can force others to labor for them,
> and they can very well decide merely to use and enjoy the world of the things
> without themselves adding a single useful object to it...
> A life without speech and without action, on the other hand—and this is the only way of life
> that in earnest has renounced all appearance and all vanity in the biblical sense of the word—
> is literally dead to the world; it has ceased to be a human life because it is no longer
> lived among men.

> If action as beginning corresponds to the fact of birth, if it is the actualization of the human
> condition of natality, then speech corresponds to the fact of distinctness and is the actualization of
> the human condition of plularity, that is, of living as a distinct and unique being among equals.

> In acting and speaking, men show who they are, reveal actively their unique personal identities
> and thus make their appearance in the human world, while their physical identities appear without
> any activity of their own in the unique shape of the body and sound of their voice.
