I am a senior at the University of Chicago. I study Computational Applied Math, Economics, and Statistics with a specialization in Machine Learning and Data Science.

I am mainly interested in developing data efficient learning methods to build intelligent agents that generalize to real world scenarios. Broadly I am interested in reinforcement learning, online learning, and robotics.

I am a big believer in intuition- both in understanding and in explanation- and hope to share some of the things that I’ve learned or projects that I have found interesting here on this site!
