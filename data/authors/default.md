**About Me**

I am a research scientist at Springtail.ai researching methods to improve transformer learning sample efficiency.

Previously I graduated from the University of Chicago in 2023, where I studied Computational Applied Math (BS), Statistics (BS), and Economics (BA). During that time, I also studied machine learning theory and did machine learning research at the Toyota Technical Institute of Chicago.

I am a firm advocate of a growth and learning mindset.
I am also a big believer in intuition- both in understanding and in explanation- and hope to share some of the things that Iâ€™ve learned here.

In my free time, I enjoy singing, learning about other people's stories (ex: through memoirs), and leisurely walks.  
ðŸ“–: Currently learning about efficient learning, meta RL
