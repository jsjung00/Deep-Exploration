**About Me**

I graduated from the University of Chicago in 2023, where I studied Computational Applied Math (BS), Statistics (BS), and Economics (BA) with specializations in Machine Learning and Data Science.

I am a firm advocate of a growth and learning mindset.
I am also a big believer in intuition- both in understanding and in explanation- and hope to share some of the things that I’ve learned here.
