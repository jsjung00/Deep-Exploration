**About Me**

I graduated from the University of Chicago in 2023, where I studied Computational Applied Math (BS), Economics (BA), and Statistics (BS) with specializations in Machine Learning and Data Science.

Broadly I am interested in machine learning, both theoretical and applied, and reinforcement learning.

I am a big believer in intuition- both in understanding and in explanation- and hope to share some of the things that Iâ€™ve learned here.

**Note:** I am actively seeking full time job opportunities.
