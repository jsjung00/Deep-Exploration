**About Me**

I am a research scientist at Chan Zuckerberg Imaging Institute. Broadly I am interested in generative models and am currently working on their applications to biology, specifically 3D reconstruction of protein structures.

Previously I was a research scientist at Springtail.ai, where I worked on sample efficient reasoning algorithms.

I graduated from the University of Chicago, where I studied Computational Applied Math, Statistics, and Economics. During that time, I also studied statistical learning theory and machine learning and worked on reinforcement learning at the Toyota Technical Institute of Chicago.

I am a firm advocate of a growth and learning mindset.
I am also a big believer in intuition- both in understanding and in explanation- and hope to share some of the things that Iâ€™ve learned here.

In my free time, I enjoy singing, learning about other people's stories (ex: through memoirs), leisurely walks, and writing.
