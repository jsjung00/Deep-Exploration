**About Me**

I am a senior at the University of Chicago. I study Computational Applied Math, Economics, and Statistics with a specialization in Machine Learning and Data Science.

Broadly I am interested in machine learning, both theoretical and applied, and robotics, particularly reinforcement learning.

I am a big believer in intuition- both in understanding and in explanation- and hope to share some of the things that Iâ€™ve learned or projects that I have found interesting here on this site!
