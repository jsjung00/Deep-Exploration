I am a senior at the University of Chicago studying Applied Math, Economics, and Statistics with specializations in Machine Learning and Data Science.
I am particularly excited about machine learning research and applications and like to think about challenging data science problems.

I love learning and find many recent developments in machine learning to be like magic. I've listed some of the particularly interesting projects and ideas that I've come across in this site.

My ultimate aim is to build highly positively impactful, scalable solutions- modern technology excites me with its potential to solve real, human problems. I see huge opportunities with the intersection of big data and robust models and thus strive to develop a strong theoretical understanding of data-driven solutions.
