**About Me**

I am a research scientist at Biohub. Broadly I am interested in generative models and am currently working on their applications to biology.

Previously I was a research scientist at Springtail.ai, where I worked on sample efficient reasoning algorithms. Before that, I graduated from the University of Chicago with degrees in Computational Applied Math, Statistics, and Economics. I also worked on reinforcement learning at the Toyota Technical Institute at Chicago.

I like to share research insights on my blog and occasionally post on X.

**Things I've been recently thinking about**

- Diffusion memorization and generalization
- Inference time scaling of protein language models to solve difficult design tasks [(project page)](https://inference-scaling-proteins.vercel.app/)
