**About Me**

I am a research scientist at the Biohub. Broadly I am interested in generative models and am currently working on their applications to biology.

Previously I was a research scientist at Springtail.ai, where I worked on sample efficient reasoning algorithms.

I graduated from the University of Chicago with degrees in Computational Applied Math, Statistics, and Economics. During that time, I also had to fortune of learning statistical learning theory and working on reinforcement learning at the Toyota Technical Institute of Chicago.


I am a big believer in intuition- both in understanding and in explanation- and hope to share some of the things that I’ve learned here.

In my free time, I enjoy singing, learning about other people's stories (ex: through memoirs), leisurely walks, and writing.
